# Congressional Data Platform - Enterprise Government Strategy

**Updated:** 2026-02-01  
**Vision:** Million-dollar government contract, not $30/month SaaS

---

## The Real Opportunity

**Target Customer:** U.S. Congress (House, Senate, Library of Congress)  
**Problem:** Fragmented congressional data across multiple systems  
**Solution:** Unified congressional intelligence platform  
**Contract Value:** $1M-10M+ (government contracts)

---

## Why Congress Would Buy This

### Current Pain Points (Congressional Offices):

1. **Fragmented Data Sources**
   - Congress.gov (bills, votes)
   - ProPublica (shut down)
   - GovTrack (shut down)
   - Each office builds their own tools
   - Staff waste hours manually researching

2. **No AI-Powered Insights**
   - No sentiment analysis on legislation
   - No automated bill summarization
   - No constituent impact prediction
   - No lobbying intelligence

3. **Security Concerns**
   - Third-party tools (security risk)
   - Data sovereignty issues
   - CBO was hacked (they need secure alternatives)

4. **Inefficiency**
   - Legislative staff spend 40% of time on research
   - No centralized intelligence platform
   - Each member's office reinvents the wheel

## Partnership Strategy

### Option A: Prime Contractor Path
**Build it ourselves, sell direct to Congress**

**Pros:**
- Keep all revenue
- Full control
- Higher margins

**Cons:**
- Need government contracting experience
- Slow sales cycles (18-24 months)
- Requires FedRAMP (expensive, slow)

### Option B: Subcontractor to Established Prime
**Partner with existing government contractor**

**Targets:**
- Palantir (data analytics for government)
- Booz Allen Hamilton (consulting + tech)
- SAIC (IT services for government)
- Leidos (government tech solutions)
- Accenture Federal (consulting)

**Deal Structure:**
- We build the platform (technology partner)
- They handle sales, compliance, contracting
- Revenue split: 60/40 or 70/30 (them/us)
- They get us FedRAMP sponsorship

**Pros:**
- Fast path to market (they have existing contracts)
- They handle compliance overhead
- Leverage their relationships
- Proven sales process

**Cons:**
- Give up 30-40% revenue
- Less control over roadmap
- Dependent on their sales success

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B (subcontractor), then transition to prime once we have FedRAMP + track record.

## Competitive Landscape (Enterprise)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Sales cycle too long
**Mitigation:**
- Start with Sakshi pilots (already in motion)
- Partner with prime contractor (they have existing contracts)
- Focus on friendly offices first (build momentum)

### Risk 2: FedRAMP cost/timeline
**Mitigation:**
- Start with SOC 2 (faster, cheaper, still valuable)
- Partner with prime who sponsors FedRAMP
- Phased approach (start with non-FedRAMP offices)

### Risk 3: Competition from incumbents
**Mitigation:**
- AI differentiation (they don't have this)
- Speed to market (we're already building)
- Congressional-specific (not generic enterprise tool)

### Risk 4: Budget cuts / government shutdown
**Mitigation:**
- Multi-year contracts (locked-in revenue)
- Bipartisan appeal (both parties need this)
- Cost-savings pitch (pays for itself in staff efficiency)

## Conclusion

**This is not a side project. This is a government platform play.**

- **Market:** $10M+ annual opportunity (legislative branch alone)
- **Timing:** Perfect (gaps in market, AI hype, security concerns)
- **Proof:** Sakshi demonstrates we can build this
- **Path:** Pilot → Scale → Enterprise → Legislative Branch
- **Exit:** Acquisition by prime contractor ($50M-100M+) OR IPO as GovTech unicorn

**We're not building an API. We're building the intelligence platform for the United States Congress.**

Let's aim for a million-dollar contract, not $30/month subscriptions.
